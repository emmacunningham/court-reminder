## Fill in secrets files (these contain API keys, lists of numbers for which you want info):
You will need to set up accounts with the various services that we use (Twilio, Google Clound, Azure Storage table).  
You will then need to fill in the various secrets files with your credentials for these accounts.  Copy secrets sample and then fill in the blanks.  (cp secrets.sample.py secrets.py)
The secrets files are located in the following folders:

  1. Call -- ~\CourtHearings\court-reminder\call\secrets.py
  To fill out this information, you first need a Twilio account. Set up one at www.twilio.com.  Then edit the fields in the secret file: ~\CourtHearings\court-reminder\call\secrets.py
  Your AccountSid and AuthToken can be found on your Account Dashboard. 
 
  2. Storage -- ~\CourtHearings\court-reminder\storage\secrets.py
  We use an Azure storage account for this.  Here are instructions on how to set up an Azure storage account. 
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-create-storage-account#create-a-storage-account
  You will want to set up one general table and one blob storage table

## Run
Two parts:
1. Running the runners (transcribing, calling, extracting)
  - python ./court-reminder/runners.py
2. Running the servers (twiml server, admin server)
  - python start_server.py --twilio_prod
  - python start_server.py --admin_prod

## Allow http access
Go to network interfaces
Retrieve name of security group
Search for name of security roup
Add new rule to inbound security rules 
Port range 8080. Name httpaccess
Password for this will be in the secrets.py file in the server folder in the repo

## install python 3   
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-pip3 -y

screen -S <screen_name>
python3 start_server.py --twilio_prod
<CTRL A-D>

screen -S <screen_name>
python3 start_server.py --admin_prod
<CTRL A-D>

[<CTRL A-D> exits but does not terminate the screen]
[screen -r <screen_name> returns to the screen to check the status]
[<CTRL D> terminates the screen]
